# Project OpenPoultry
  This project is a note taking and record keeping system with 
a website, IOS, and Android apps. Its goal is to provide 4-H'ers
with a system to easily record notes and experences from their
market chicken project. Additional, using their observations, they 
can create a good game plan for the following year.
## Now *"lets make the Best Better!"*
I asked Bard (Gemini now), "create a design for a 4-H maket poultry note taking website" and he said:  
  
  Here is a design for a 4-H market poultry note taking website:

* **Homepage:** The homepage should be clean and easy to use. It should have a large search bar at the top, so 4-H members can quickly find the information they need. The homepage should also have a list of popular notes, as well as a section for featured notes.
* **Notes:** Notes should be organized into categories, such as breeds, feeding, housing, breeding, and showing. Each note should have a title, a description, and any relevant images or videos. 4-H members should be able to add comments to notes, and they should also be able to rate and favorite notes.
* **Calendar:** The website should have a calendar that 4-H members can use to track important dates, such as competitions and shows, as well as weather forecasts.
* **Weather:** The website should have a weather forecast that is specific to the 4-H member's location. This will help 4-H members to plan their poultry accordingly.
* **Chatroom:** The website should have a chatroom where 4-H members can ask questions and get help from other 4-H members. This is a great way for 4-H members to learn from each other and share their experiences.
* **Forum:** The website should have a forum where 4-H members can discuss poultry topics. This is a great way for 4-H members to learn about new poultry practices and to get advice from other 4-H members.

The website should be designed in a way that is easy to use for 4-H members of all ages. The colors should be bright and inviting, and the font should be easy to read. The website should also be mobile-friendly, so that 4-H members can access it from their phones and tablets.

Here are some additional features that could be included in the website:

* A breed information tool that provides detailed information about different poultry breeds.
* A feeding calculator that helps 4-H members to calculate the correct amount of food to feed their poultry.
* A housing guide that provides tips on how to build and maintain a poultry coop.
* A breeding guide that provides tips on how to breed poultry.
* A showing guide that provides tips on how to show poultry in competitions.

These are just a few ideas for a 4-H market poultry note taking website. The specific features that are included will depend on the needs of the 4-H members who use the website.

Here are some additional features that could be included in the website to make it more specific to 4-H market poultry:

* A section for 4-H members to share their poultry show experiences.
* A section for 4-H members to ask questions about poultry showing.
* A section for 4-H members to find mentors who can help them with their poultry projects.
* A section for 4-H members to find scholarships and grants to help them with their poultry projects.

These features would help 4-H members to learn more about poultry showing and to get the most out of their 4-H poultry projects.
